 Part 1: Industry; India's Renewable Power Journey
India's Electricity Challenge: Mee ng Growing Demand
Did you know that India is the world's third-largest electricity producer? In FY22, the country
consumed a whopping 1.7-petawa hours (PWh) (1,700 BU) of electricity! Most of this (86%) comes
from u lity genera on, totalling 1.48 PWh. Despite this, India's per capita power consump on is s ll
rela vely low at 1255 kWh. This is partly because the power industry's growth hasn't quite kept up
with the rapid increase in demand.
Historic Peak Power Demand
Guess what? In May 2024, India's peak power demand hit a record 250 GW! Looking ahead, India's
power demand is expected to grow by 70% by 2032 due to rising urbaniza on and increased demand
from various sectors.
Power Sector: Renewable vs Non-Renewable
The solar energy sector in India is booming! Rising demand for roo op installa ons and the use of
solar power in cap ve setups is driving this growth. It's es mated that solar capacity will exceed 280
GW, with an addi onal 125 GW needed to meet the GoI's goal of producing 5 million metric tons of
green hydrogen. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has a plan to add 50 GW of
renewable capacity annually over the next ﬁve years, with quarterly bids of 10-15 GW.

Conclusion
Isn't it exci ng to see how India is transforming its energy landscape? With the government's
suppor ve policies and strategic ini a ves, the country is paving the way for a cleaner, more
sustainable future. Whether you're an investor, a business owner, or just someone who cares about
the environment, there's no denying that India's renewable energy journey is something to watch!

Part 2: Transforming from India's Leading Module Manufacturer to a
Renewable Energy Powerhouse
XYZ Ltd (XYZ) is on an Exci ng New Journey!
XYZ is not just s cking to solar module manufacturing anymore. They're diving deep into the
renewable energy sector, expanding into ingot, cell, wafer, and module setups. Here's a closer look at
their transforma on:
Business & Opera ons


Leading the Pack: XYZ Corp is the leading company listed in the Approved List of Models and
Manufacturers (ALMM). Addi onally, they are among the few companies capable of
producing M12 mono PERC and bifacial modules.



Understanding Solar Modules: These are the core components of solar power systems,
consis ng of numerous solar cells that convert sunlight into electricity. Most of the world's
polysilicon wafers (which are used in solar cells) come from China, holding about 80% of the
global market.



State-of-the-Art Facili es: XYZ Corp operates automated produc on lines across ﬁve
factories, with plans for addi onal facili es underway.



Innova ve Technology: They were among the ﬁrst to develop commercially viable advanced
TOP-CON technology modules, known for their high eﬃciency.



Strong Collabora ons: XYZ works closely with the government, has joint ventures (JVs), and
partners with high-proﬁle clients, suppliers, and technology experts.



Quality Assurance: They boast the ﬁrst and only NABL-accredited laboratory in India for
tes ng PV modules.

Key Highlights


Rapid Capacity Expansion: XYZ's capacity grew from 4 GW in 2022 to 12 GW by October
2023. They're also se ng up a 5.4 GW solar cell manufacturing facility in Chikhli, Gujarat,
which is expected to be opera onal by the end of FY24.



Impressive Order Book: XYZ is the second-largest solar module exporter to the USA, a er
China, with an order book worth ₹47,000 Crores, transla ng to over 18 GW. The Indian solar
manufacturing sector is booming, with big players like Adani and Vikram Solar planning
signiﬁcant expansions.



Domina ng the Market: XYZ captured a 67.9% share of India's solar export market in FY23,
valued at ₹4,616.5 Crores.



Leadership: Hitesh Doshi, the Chairman and Managing Director, has over 21 years of
experience in the engineering industry. He holds a bachelor’s degree in commerce from the
University of Mumbai and a doctorate in professional entrepreneurship in business project
management from the European Con nental University. Under his leadership, Waaree

Renewable Technologies Ltd (WRTL), the EPC subsidiary of XYZ, saw a remarkable 1665%
year-on-year growth in FY24 and maintained a ﬁve-year CAGR of 324%. XYZ holds a 74.5%
stake in WRTL as of the end of FY23.


Expanding Product Por olio: The group is also stepping into ba ery manufacturing through
Waaree Technologies Ltd (WTL), where promoters hold a 59.1% share. Recently, they
announced their entry into the electrolyser business.

Conclusion
XYZ's journey from a leading solar module manufacturer to a comprehensive renewable energy
powerhouse is truly remarkable. With their extensive growth, innova ve technologies, and strong
market presence, they're XYZ on their way to transforming the renewable energy landscape in India.
This makes them an exci ng prospect for anyone looking into the renewable energy sector!
Part 3: Impressive Financial Growth and Future Expansion Plans for Waaree Energy Ltd (XYZ)
Outstanding Financial Performance in FY23
XYZ has achieved an astounding year-on-year net proﬁt growth of 528% in FY23. Their Return on
Equity (ROE) and Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) are also impressive. To support their next phase
of expansion, they successfully raised over ₹2,000 Crores through private placements (₹540
premium, pre-money valua on of ₹4,500 Crores). An addi onal ₹4,000 Crores will be ﬁnanced
through debt, and the rest will be raised through an IPO planned for FY25. These funds will be used
to expand their wafer-to-module produc on capacity by 6 GW.
Strong Debt Management and Growth Strategy
Under the leadership of Doshi and Mehta, XYZ has eﬀec vely managed debt-driven expansion. Their
leverage levels have decreased from 2.1 in FY16 to less than 1 since FY20. Despite this, they
maintained a solid average interest coverage ra o of 2.5 between FY16 and FY23. Ini ally, their ROE
was driven by leverage un l FY19, but in recent years, rising asset turns and net proﬁts have become
the primary drivers of ROE growth.
IPO Plans and Market Valua on
According to their latest Dra Red Herring Prospectus (Q3 FY24), XYZ has 25.3 Crore shares
outstanding on a diluted basis. The IPO will include fresh issues worth ₹3,000 Crores and an Oﬀer for
Sale (OFS) of 35 lakh shares. As per ET sources, the IPO is es mated to be valued at $3 billion with a
10% dilu on. The cumula ve earnings for Q1 and Q2 of FY24 were ₹3,382 Crores, with net proﬁt
margins of 10%.
Annualizing the EPS of the ﬁrst two quarters and considering the current market price (CMP) of
₹2,250, the current P/E ra o is 82. However, as of April, CareEdge es mates the opera ng income to
reach ₹10,000 Crores in FY24. With an expected 10% dilu on and 10% net proﬁt margin, the
es mated EPS for FY24 is ₹35, resul ng in an es mated P/E ra o of 62.

Exit Strategy


Short Term (less than 1 year): In 2024, domes c IPOs have provided an average of 61%
lis ng gains. The top 10 IPOs from CY21 to CY23 oﬀered average lis ng gains of 128%, 39%,
and 87%, respec vely. Given the favourable geopoli cal climate and posi ve sen ment
towards infrastructure and development, op mal lis ng gains (~50%) can be expected for
our target’s IPO scheduled in FY25.



Long Term (3-5 years): XYZ is on a path of backward integra on, aiming to expand from the
current 12 GW to up to 35 GW by FY27, including advanced wafer, cell, and module
manufacturing. The es mated EPS could grow to ₹60 in the midterm, poten ally increasing
the share price by 120% to ₹5,000, with a forward P/E of 83.

Conclusion
XYZ's remarkable ﬁnancial growth and strategic expansion plans make it a compelling investment
opportunity. With their strong management, eﬃcient debt handling, and ambi ous future projects,
XYZ is well-posi oned to con nue its upward trajectory in the renewable energy sector. Whether
you're looking for a long-term investment or a short-term gain, XYZ presents a promising prospect.
